upon the gameplay loading, the "help" command is run immediately to show you what commands are available
(if a command has an entry in the manual, it will say "has manual" next to it when the "help" command is used, however the manual is not functional yet)
you can type commands in the grey bar at the bottom middle of the gameplay screen

here's how the gameplay is intended to play out:
Explore as much of the world as possible in 1 month, a Scientist fleet will arrive to take over once the month is over
the Automatons have some sentience designed into them so they will naturally wander and collect Goo despite not being asked to
use the Command Line to:
> send Missions to the Automatons
> Requests to your Crew
> Rezi can be sent to explore new tiles and possibly find more ponds that can be harvested
> Marl can work on new or improved equipment for Crew and Automatons
> Rezi and Marl can be sent together to build new Signal Towers to extend the range of tiles visible by the ship's systems
> allocate amounts of Goo for Yamari to process into Materials
> allocate amounts of Goo for Yamari to experiment with and possibly find new or better recipes for processing Goos into Materials
